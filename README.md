# Computer Science Bootcamp Journey

Welcome to my Computer Science Bootcamp journal.

This section tracks my focused, high-intensity study of Computer Science fundamentals using Python as my primary tool. Every project, lesson, and challenge reflects a deliberate step toward professional software engineering mastery and advanced AI development.

## What I've Been Working On:

- **Python Programming for Computer Science**  
  - Mastering variables, data types, conditionals, loops (`for`, `while`), functions, and modular code design.  
  - Deep work with sets and dictionaries for efficient data handling and problem-solving.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  - Building real-world OOP systems using classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.  
  - Practicing clean design patterns that prepare for large-scale software development.

- **Algorithmic Thinking and Problem Solving**  
  - Solving foundational CS challenges: reversing integers, finding max values, recursive logic, and clean control flow.  
  - Developing structured, step-by-step solutions optimized for clarity and performance.

- **Computer Science Fundamentals**  
  - Strengthening foundations in control flow, memory management, program architecture, and logical decomposition.

- **AI and Machine Learning Preparation**  
  - Building Python, math, and logic skills to create a real base for AI development.  
  - Treating CS mastery as a required step before any serious AI/ML work.

## Learning Strategy:

- **Theory Deep Dives**  
  Breaking down complex CS topics into simple, actionable understanding before touching the keyboard.

- **Hands-On Implementation**  
  Reinforcing theory through immediate coding practice, structured exercises, and progressively challenging projects.

- **Build and Apply**  
  Every concept is applied in a real-world or simulated project to move beyond memorization into mastery.
